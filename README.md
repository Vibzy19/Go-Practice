# Go-Practice

This repository will focus on learing Go.

## Progress

### 1> Hello World !

> Go packages and directory strucure for compilation
```sh
> /nameofgocomppath
> /nameofgocomppath/src
> /nameofgocomppath/src/helloworld/main.go
> /nameofgocomppath/bin
> /nameofgocomppath/pkg
```
```sh
$ export GOPATH="/name/of/go/comp/path"
$ go install package1
$ go install package2
```
> Go packages and directory strucure after compilation
```sh
> /nameofgocomppath
> /nameofgocomppath/src
> /nameofgocomppath/src/helloworld/main.go
> /nameofgocomppath/bin
> /nameofgocomppath/bin/helloworld
> /nameofgocomppath/pkg
```

### 2> Strings

Different ways of formatting and printing stuff.


### 3> Console Input

Taking in User Input from the console with bufio and fmt's Scanln.
Apart from this we also see how to handle the input which we return from the console.


### 4> Variables
Types for variables can be set explicitly or implicitly.
"=" operator is for explicit and ":=" is for implicit.
As Go is a statically typed language these values cannot be changed during runtime.

Constants in Go use "=" for both implicit and explicit declaration.
Go also has pointers.

#### Arithmatic Operations
+ , - . * , / , %
&  Bitwise AND
|  Bitwise OR
^  Bitwise XOR
&^ Bit Clear
<< LeftShift
>> Rightshift

Mathematics requires the same types for the operators to function properly

#### Types
bool
string 
uint8-64 (number of bits)
int8-64 (number of bits)
byte 
int
uintptr (large enough to hold the bit pattern of any pointer)
float32-64
complex64-128 (Complex Numbers)
Arrays
Slices
Maps
Structs
Functions
Interfaces
Channels
Pointers
