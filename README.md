# Go-Practice

This repository will focus on learing Go.

## Progress

### 1> Hello World !

> Go packages and directory strucure for compilation
```sh
> /nameofgocomppath
> /nameofgocomppath/src
> /nameofgocomppath/src/helloworld/main.go
> /nameofgocomppath/bin
> /nameofgocomppath/pkg
```
```sh
$ export GOPATH="/name/of/go/comp/path"
$ go install package1
$ go install package2
```
> Go packages and directory strucure after compilation
```sh
> /nameofgocomppath
> /nameofgocomppath/src
> /nameofgocomppath/src/helloworld/main.go
> /nameofgocomppath/bin
> /nameofgocomppath/bin/helloworld
> /nameofgocomppath/pkg
```

### 2> Strings

Different ways of formatting and printing stuff.


### 3> Console Input

Taking in User Input from the console with bufio and fmt's Scanln.
Apart from this we also see how to handle the input which we return from the console.


### 4> Variables
Types for variables can be set explicitly or implicitly.
"=" operator is for explicit and ":=" is for implicit.
As Go is a statically typed language these values cannot be changed during runtime.

Constants in Go use "=" for both implicit and explicit declaration.
"time" package allows to use different time operations.

#### Arithmatic Operations
+ , - . * , / , %
"&"  Bitwise AND
"|"  Bitwise OR
"^"  Bitwise XOR
"&^" Bit Clear
"<<" LeftShift
">>" Rightshift

Mathematics requires the same types for the operators to function properly

#### Types
bool
string 
uint8-64 (number of bits)
int8-64 (number of bits)
byte 
int
uintptr (large enough to hold the bit pattern of any pointer)
float32-64
complex64-128 (Complex Numbers)
Arrays
Slices
Maps
Structs
Functions
Interfaces
Channels
Pointers

### 5> Pointers

These are the same as they would be in C, C++.
Similarly "&" would be to get the address of the value and "*" would be to point to the value.

### 6> Arrays

#### Arrays

Arrays are declared in the following way
```sh
var arr [1]string;
arr[0] = "value"
```

#### Slices

Slices are no different from Arrays with the only difference being that their size is not fixed, they are declared differently and they make up arrays.
```go
var sli1 []string;
var arr [5]int = [3]int{1,2,3,4,5};
sli2 := append(arr[1:3]);
```

### 7> Memory Allocation

- The runtime operates in its own background threads. Memory is managed completely in the background and no allocation of deallocation of memory needs to be handled by the programmer. 
- make(), new() are used to create instances of Maps, Slices, Channels
```sh
new()  // Allocates but does not initalize memory, returns address
make() // Allocates and initalizes memory, returns address
```
- The Go Garbage Collector deallocated memory for objects which are out of scope or set to nil.

#### Maps

So maps can be declared in the following way
```go
mp := make(map[int]string) 
```
In the above example we are creating maps which would have the keys as integers and the value for the key as a string. 
Maps are similar to dictionaries in Python with the difference being that the Keys and Values can be of only one type.

#### Structs

Structs are the same as they are in C. They are declared as follows.
```go
type Dog struct {
    Breed string
    Weight int
}
```
They are meant to be used like classes, but Go doesn't have the advanced OOP concepts such as inheritance and such. The only OOP Concepts it has are Encapslation and Type Memeber functions.

### 8> Functions

Basic functions in Go are little different than the normal way we end up writing functions.
```go
func function(value int) int {
    integervalue := 100
    return integervalue
}

func function(value int, value2 string) (int, string){
    return 10, "word"
}

func function(value int, value string) (number int, sentence string){
    number = value+10
    sentence = value+"adddedForReturn"
    return
}
```
#### Functions for Custom Types

Custom Types would be structs which would act like Types which would be made by you.
```go
type Dog struct {
    Breed string
    Weight int
    Sound string
}
```

Functions for Custom Types
```go
func (d Dog) Speak(){
    fmt.Println(d.Sound)   
}
```

### 9> Interfaces

Interfaces are basically wrapper structs. 
* Interfaces should be declared along with the structs that need to be declared which can use these interfaces.
* If there are functions which are a part of the interface and would be inherited by the structs which we are taking about, the functions need to be declared for each of the structs.
* We can say that interfaces help to define common attributes or functions for similar objects or structs.

### 10> Error Handling

Go does not ahve the usual error handling stuff we ahve in other languages.
Instead we ahve the "errors" package with which we can make and erro object which allows us to basically form a template for handling errors properly
```go
import "errors"
import "fmt"

func main() {
    MyError := errors.New("Error !!")
    fmt.Println(MyError.Error()) // gives the same output as fmt.Println(MyError)
}
```
* We usually define a function to return an error along with any toher value it might return. 
* Error handling goes hand in hand with conditionals as there is no exception handling of sorts.


### 11> Really Simple Web App

We use the "net/http" package to initialize a http socket and write data to response using the following functions.

```go
func main(){
    http.HandleFunc("/path",handlerfunction)
    http.ListenandServe(":3000",nil) // We would be listening on the port 3000
}
func handlerfunction(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request){
    Fprintf(w, "Writing to the Resopnse") 
}
```

### 12> Methods / Functions and their Receivers

Methods in Go have receivers which are basically the object/struct they work on. 
Revceivers are basically "this" is Java or "self" in Python.

#### Value Receivers
We consider using these in case we need to use the values which have been declared in a n instance of a particular custom type.
```go
func (c Car) function(){}
```

#### Pointer Receivers
We consider using these if we want to make changes to the already existing values in the instance of the custom type.
```go
func (c *Car) function(){}
```

### 13> Simple Web Scraping
Here we are going to start looking into how we can get data from the internet and parse it in a simple webscraping web app.
```go
import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http" // for making the get request
    "io/ioutil" // foir reading the response and getting the output in bytes
    "encoding/xml" // This library allows us to parse xml very nicely
)
```
> Important functions
```go
http.Get() // returns response and error
ioutil.ReadAll() //returns bytes and error
xml.Unmarshall() // based on reflection, need to be give the bytes and the struct where we will place our data
```
#### Struct tags

```go
type Urlset struct {
    Urls []Url `xml:"url"` // The third element here is a struct tag which would be used by reflection which we would look into further
}
type Url struct {
    Location string `xml:"loc`
}
func (u Url) String() string { // This is a GOhack as I would like to call it which would allow for returning a string instead of Url Type to the Urlset struct
    return u.Sprintf(u.Location)
}
```
